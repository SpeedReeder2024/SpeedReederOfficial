    <h2>Why read like this?</h2>
    <p>
      When reading a form of media like a book or article in this age of hyper - stimulation, and 'dopamine hacking', it can feel hard if not impossible to keep your eyes on the words, and not stray off thinking about something else or worse, picking up the phone. Speedreeder.com hopes to offer a middle ground, one in which you can enjoy the experience of a long-form book or article, while ensuring that you can stay focused on the words being presented to you. On top of that, this form of reading can help people read up to 3x faster, giving them the same experience as a book, while having it infringe less upon your day.

    <h2>Can I retain what I read?</h2>
    <p>
        Of course you can! That is, with the proper usage of the tool. With a tool like SpeedReeder, you're given the power to immediately crank up the wpm to a thousand, and be done with your boring reading assignment in 10 minutes. If that's what you want out of the site, you do you! However, for those seeking to actually absorb the information in an effecient way, something this tool promises to do, I would encourage slowly stepping up the speed of the reader, utilising the 'Back 10 words', to re-read a sentence, and finally pausing and reading the preview text if necessary. Done properly, I hope you find this tool as useful as I have!

    <h2>I hate ads.</h2>
    <p>Me too. Unfortunately as a solo-programmer, I rely on ads as my sole revenue stream from this wesbite. Not to worry, however - In the works is a premium system, in which a user sick of ads like you, can pay a few bucks to never see them again. That way you can focus on speed reading, and I can still live off the site.</p>
