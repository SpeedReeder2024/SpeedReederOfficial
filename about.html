    <h1>The 'SpeedReeder' Method</h1>
  </header>

  
  <section class="about-intro">
    <h2>RSVP</h2>
    <p>RSVP, or Rapid serial visual presentation is a method of reading mostly known for its scientific purpose of measuring how fast people can read words. It does this by rapidly flashing words in one location in front of the user. More recently, RSVP has been displayed in the media, most of the time as an online 'challenge' to see in what percentile of speed readers you sit in.
       At Speedreeder.com, we want to bring this method of reading mainstream, as we beleive it can improve the ability for readers to digest information, and decrease distractions while reading, all while maintaining the levels of comprehension on the text. (see elaboration below) Speedreeder.com is a tool that everyone can use, from college students on a crunch, or employees trying to increase effeciency.

    <h2>The Comprehension Issue</h2>
    <p>One of the main critisms of the RSVP method, is that the nature of only being shown one word at a time, and not being able to go back words on command decreases reader's comprehension levels, however we've tackled this issue head-on, and beleive that through the introduction of features such the 'preview text', and the 'back 10 words' button mitigate this possibility. However, the best way to maintain
        comperehension while utilising SpeedReeder, is to pace yourself, truly absorb what you're being shown, and become familiar with the tools we've provided.

    <h2>The Future of Speedreeder</h2>
    <p>The current version of Speedreeder.com is still the beta version. In the future I'd like to integrate a premium version, costing a few bucks a month so you guys don't have to get distracted by ads as my primary form of revenue. I'd also like to add a functionality in which you can set a background for the reading page - a kind of screensaver to go behind the text, to make for a more asthetic, relaxing experience. Regardless, I've got plenty of ideas for the future of this tool, so stay tuned, and submit your ideas in the contact/feedback page!</p>
